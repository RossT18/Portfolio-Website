# Portfolio-Website

My portfolio website, hosted using GitHub Pages.

https://rosst18.github.io/Portfolio-Website/


This website was fully designed and developed by myself.

## Behind The Scenes
The "Projects" section of the website loads projects saved in a .JSON file, so projects can be easily added to the page without the need for writing / copying HTML code.
Within `script.js`, the projects are loaded and added to the document using JS and jQuery.
This script also manages the slideshow background.
