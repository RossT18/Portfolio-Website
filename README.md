# Portfolio-Website

My portfolio website, hosted using GitHub Pages.

https://rosst18.github.io/Portfolio-Website/


This website was fully designed and developed by myself.

## Behind The Scenes
The "Projects" section of the website loads projects saved in a .JSON file, so projects can be easily added to the page without the need for writing / copying HTML code.
Within `js\script.js`, the projects are loaded and added to the document using JS and jQuery.

## Background Image Slideshow

The background of the website is a slideshow of images taken during various trips and is created using JavaScript.
The first image is a photo of Jet d'Eau in Geneva.
The second is a photo of Verona from Castel San Pietro.
The third is a photo taken of Lake Windermere in the Lake District National Park.

All background images can be found in original and compressed quality within the `img\backgrounds` folder.
